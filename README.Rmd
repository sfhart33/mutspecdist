## AMSD method summary

<img src="man/figures/Figure1_2025-04-29.png" width="100%" />

- Input mutation spectra for each sample in a cohort divided into two groups. As an example here we have a group of tumors unexposed (blue) or exposed (gold) to carcinogen.
- AMSD aggregates mutation spectra for each group and calculates the cosine distance between the aggregate spectra (green).
- AMSD also randomly reshuffles group labels to calculate the cosine distance between randomly sampled tumors (grey), repeating 1000+ times to create a null distribution expectation.
- AMSD then calculates a p-value from the fraction of random samplings that are greater than or equal to the observed distance between the two groups, as visualized in the histogram.
- To interpret what mutational mechanisms may be behind a significant difference, we recommend applying mutational signature fitting to the aggregate spectra and/or individual samples and comparing between the two groups.

## Installation

```{r install-load, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sfhart33/mutspecdist")
library(mutspecdist)
```

## Usage Example

Load example data
```{r example-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(mouse_sample_table)
data(mouse_carcinogen_counts)
mouse_carcinogen_spectra <- mouse_carcinogen_counts/rowSums(mouse_carcinogen_counts)
```
Example comparison: Oxazepam-exposed vs control mouse tumors
```{r}
# function to output spectra
group_spectra <- function(spectra, exp, tis){
  exposure <- mouse_sample_table$exposure == exp &
    mouse_sample_table$tissue == tis
  exp_samples <-  mouse_sample_table$label[exposure]
  exp_spectra <- spectra[exp_samples,]
  return(exp_spectra)
}

# mutation spectra for tumors exposed to Oxazepam
  ox_spectra <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_spectra, "OXAZEPAM", "LIVER")
  knitr::kable(ox_spectra)

# mutation spectra for spontaneously arising tumors
  control_spectra <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_spectra, "SPONTANEOUS", "LIVER")
  knitr::kable(control_spectra)
```
Run AMSD and plot output. The observed cosine distance between the groups is higher than all 1000 re-sampling permutations, yielding *p* < 0.001
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Run AMSD
  exp_v_con <- amsd(ox_spectra,
                    control_spectra,
                    seed = 123)
# Visualize result
  plot_amsd_histogram(exp_v_con)
```

Run with more permutations for a more accurate p-value
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  exp_v_con <- amsd(ox_spectra,
                    control_spectra,
                    n_sim = 10000,
                    seed = 123)
  plot_amsd_histogram(exp_v_con)
```

Run with a noisier exposure exposure set: TCP-exposed
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  tcp_spectra <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_spectra, "1,2,3_TRICHLOROPROPANE", "LIVER")
  control_spectra <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_spectra, "SPONTANEOUS", "LIVER")

  exp_v_con <- amsd(tcp_spectra,
                    control_spectra,
                    n_sim = 10000,
                    seed = 123)
  plot_amsd_histogram(exp_v_con)
```

A closer look reveals that 6/10,000 re-sampling permutations have the same cosine distance as the observed between the exposure and control sets, indicating they sampled the original sets by chance
```{r}
exp_v_con$cosine
exp_v_con$sims[exp_v_con$sims >= exp_v_con$cosine]
```

Run with with "sum" option on mutation counts rather than mutation type fractions, which changes the permutation cosine distance distribution, but not the p-value, indicating the result is not driven by high- or low-mutation outliers
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  tcp_counts <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_counts, "1,2,3_TRICHLOROPROPANE", "LIVER")
  control_counts <- group_spectra(mouse_carcinogen_counts, "SPONTANEOUS", "LIVER")
  
  
  exp_v_con <- amsd(tcp_counts,
                    control_counts,
                    mean_or_sum = "sum",
                    n_sim = 10000,
                    seed = 123)
  plot_amsd_histogram(exp_v_con)
  
# total mutaiton counts per smaple
  c(rowSums(tcp_counts), rowSums(control_counts))
```
